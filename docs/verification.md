# Verification criteria

[Documentation home](../README.md) · [Scope](scope.md) · [Implementation checklist](implementation-plan.md)

**Current status: not exercised.** There is no Lupetto implementation or Go module in this workspace. This document defines future acceptance evidence, not test results.

Use focused regression tests for uncertain behavior and real smoke runs for external-tool integration. Do not replace a real build or registry check with mocks that merely echo arguments.

## Selection and snapshots

- Import a controlled snapshot and verify package metadata and provenance against its input.
- Resolve a major with multiple upstream versions and packaging revisions; verify APK-compatible ordering and architecture filtering.
- Verify that exact selection preserves the requested `-rN` revision.
- Reject conflicting selectors, ambiguous family mappings, missing versions, and unavailable package bytes without substitution.
- Preserve the exact selection used by a build when a newer snapshot is later imported.

## Build and SPDX evidence

- Run the CLI against an available real Wolfi package/version; inspect the image’s package contents and compare them with the selected version and resolved lock.
- Verify the resolved APK package set against SPDX using the agreed comparison rules. Deliberate missing, extra, or changed APK entries must fail validation; legitimate non-APK SPDX entries must follow the defined policy.
- Verify Docker loading and no-load behavior independently.
- Exercise the SBOM command through its chosen real resolution path, not an unrelated fixture document.
- Cancel or fail a build and confirm it does not report success or validated evidence. Preserve useful diagnostics without secrets.

## Publication and signatures

- Publish to a compatible test registry under a nested repository prefix; verify that the reported digest resolves to the pushed artifact.
- Reject publishing with `--no-load` before publication side effects.
- Sign and attest the same immutable digest, then verify both with the trusted public key.
- Inspect the verified attestation subject and SPDX predicate; compare the predicate with the validated local evidence.
- Verify that a wrong key or unrelated image digest cannot satisfy the expected signature/attestation checks.
- Exercise push failure and signing/attestation failure separately; report partial success accurately.
- Confirm secrets are not passed in password arguments or included in logs, result files, or downloaded evidence.

The target verification forms below are adapted to the Lupetto name. They are templates, not current runnable Lupetto instructions:

```text
cosign verify --key /path/to/lupetto.pub registry.example.com/team/lupetto/<image>@sha256:<digest>
cosign verify-attestation --key /path/to/lupetto.pub --type spdxjson registry.example.com/team/lupetto/<image>@sha256:<digest>
```

Exercise the pinned Cosign version before publishing operator examples. Local HTTP access and verification without transparency-log evidence require separately labeled variants; never make them production defaults. Successful cryptographic verification does not prove absence of vulnerabilities, SBOM completeness, or policy compliance.

## Explorer

- Build/install and exercise CLI selection, image creation, and evidence generation without installing or starting Explorer.
- Verify dependency boundaries: core/CLI packages do not import Explorer; Explorer does not import build/publication/signing internals.
- Exercise Explorer against a separately built supported CLI executable, not only a same-checkout development invocation.
- Reject unsupported request/result contract versions clearly; do not interpret human-readable logs as successful machine results.
- Verify catalog access through its chosen boundary and ensure Explorer cannot overwrite build outcomes through private state.

- Open the real UI and verify package/series navigation, metadata, and snapshot provenance.
- Confirm build controls are unavailable when builds are disabled and that requests cannot bypass that restriction.
- Launch an exact build, observe its real result, and verify local-image availability against Docker.
- Download the retained SBOM and check its content identity. Removing an eligible temporary workspace must not destroy immutable evidence.
- Exercise cancellation/failure and the chosen concurrency limit without mixing workspaces or results.
- Verify HTML escaping of package metadata and rejection of unauthorized cross-origin build requests.
- Check Products and recipe history against their defined data sources; do not present absent data as a completed history.

## Release evidence

Once code exists, run the following in each implemented Go module. A CLI release requires its applicable checks, not a completed Explorer:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Record the exact command and outcome, tool versions, exercised host/target architectures, CLI-help checks, real build/registry outcomes, and browser observations. Report unexercised scenarios explicitly.

Re-read all published flags and examples against parsing/help. Check relative documentation links and ensure no registry vendor is required. Never copy real credentials or secret-bearing command output into verification records.
